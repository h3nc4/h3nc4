## Hi, I'm Henrique ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

### Free Software Advocacy

I'm deeply committed to the principles of free software and believe in the importance of fostering freedom in software development. I believe that free software not only promotes collaboration and innovation but also empowers individuals and communities by providing access to high-quality software solutions.

### Embedded Systems Enthusiast

I am fascinated with hardware interfacing. Embedded systems captivate me due to the intricate relationship between software and hardware, indulging my passion for directly interfacing with components like sensors, actuators, and communication interfaces.

### GNU/Linux Enthusiast

My expertise primarily lies in C, Python, and Shell Scripting, providing me with a deep understanding of the GNU/Linux operating system. As my personally preferred OS, I excel in scripting automation tasks tailored for its environment. I remain committed to ongoing learning and skill refinement within the realm of unix.
